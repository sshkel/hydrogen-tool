            The NSW Powerfuel Value Chain Tool has been developed to investigate
            pathways to deploy Power-to-X technologies and help the NSW
            Governmentâ€™s aim to make the state a global Power-to-X innovation
            hub. Targeting a broad range of stakeholders, the tool can be used
            to evaluate the opportunity and potential costs of generating
            hydrogen and a selection of key powerfuels (ammonia, methanol,
            synthetic natural gas, and sustainable aviation fuel) using
            renewable power sources across NSW. A key function of the tool is to
            generate a levelized cost for hydrogen or powerfuel, which users can
            evaluate to determine the potential for developing their own
            projects in various locations across NSW.
