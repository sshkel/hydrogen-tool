            <ItemText>
              The NSW Powerfuel Value Chain Tool has been developed to
              investigate pathways to deploy Power-to-X technologies and help
              the NSW Governmentâ€™s aim to make the state a global Power-to-X
              innovation hub.

              Targeting a broad range of stakeholders, the tool can be used to
              evaluate the opportunity and potential costs of generating
              hydrogen and a selection of key powerfuels (ammonia, methanol,
              synthetic natural gas, and sustainable aviation fuel) using
              renewable power sources across NSW.
            </ItemText>
            <ItemText>
              A key function of the tool is to generate a levelized cost for
              hydrogen or powerfuel, which users can evaluate to determine the
              potential for developing their own projects in various locations
              across NSW.
